# LagerLager Addon

## What does it do?

It tracks the amount of beers cases your guild mates owe for playing bad.

## How does it work?
It's designated that only one people uses it. He is the admin and can add or remove beer cases to each person. The commands are to be used in guild chat and all prints are either to guild chat or to the admins own chat. Players can not be added in game (yet) and they have to be added in the code.

### Commands
**!lagerlager status <playername>** \
Show player's owed cases \
**!lagerlager <playername>**\
Add one case for the player \
**!lagerlager delete <playername>**\
removes one case from the player\
**!lagerlager top**\
